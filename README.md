This is the continuation of research *begun* in my Master's work at
the University of Idaho during my time as a Master's student. I graduated in 2012.

The chief aim of this repository is to build on the Targeted Trace
 Algorithm code I put together. The interested party is encouraged to
 see the papers/report.pdf, my Master's report.



This project is under Matt Might's CRAPL.
